# Digital Police 

## Overview
We propose to build a system where people are not required to do the monitor through surveillance cameras all the time called DigitalPolice. Because the availability of surveillance cameras in public has become more common, but the ability to monitor the surroundings and record the footage were still passively helping crime detection in terms of use as referring back past events that needed attention.
Our system is expected to give an automated alert when any anomalies that indicate a crime detected. So it is more plausible to take a quick response action needed.
